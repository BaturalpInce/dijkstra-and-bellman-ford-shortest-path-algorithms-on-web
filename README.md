# Shortest Path Algorithms on Web 
The website generates a random network topology based on the number of nodes provided by the user. 

After topology generation, the user can select the start and end nodes. User must also select the shortest path algorithm (Dijkstra or Bellman Ford) to execute. 

Once the algorithm is executed, user can view the Outputs and Forwarding Table.
